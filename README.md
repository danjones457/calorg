# Calendar organiser

Start of a small project to build a website that allows users to:
- Create a calendar
- Invite friends to the calendar

Their friends then insert dates they are available and the system would then return the date when all members of the calendar are available.

## The problem

When trying to organise an event with friends it can often be difficult to find a date that everyone is available to attend.

## The solution

Give users a calendar so everyone can specify the dates they are available and use the website to tell the users when everyone or most people are available.
